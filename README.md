# messaging-with-rabbit-mq-introduction
This is a set of examples showing how to work with the RabbitMq messaging framework in .NET

RabbitMq (https://www.rabbitmq.com/) is an open-source, fast, reliable and scalable messaging framework for all types of applications.

The code examples are fully documented on my blog in a series starting here: https://dotnetcodr.com/2016/08/02/messaging-with-rabbitmq-and-net-review-part-1-foundations-and-terminology/
There's a link to the subsequent part at the end of each post.
Links to all parts of the series are listed here: https://dotnetcodr.com/messaging/
